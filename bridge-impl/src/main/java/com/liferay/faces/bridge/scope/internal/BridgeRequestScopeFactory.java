/**
 * This abstract class provides a contract for defining a factory that knows how to create instances of type {@link
 * BridgeRequestScope}. It is inspired by the factory pattern found in the JSF API like {@link
 * javax.faces.context.FacesContextFactory} and {@link javax.faces.context.ExternalContextFactory}. By implementing the
 * {@link javax.faces.FacesWrapper} interface, the class provides implementations with the opportunity to wrap another
 * factory (participate in a chain-of-responsibility pattern). If an implementation wraps a factory, then it should
 * provide a one-arg constructor so that the wrappable factory can be passed at initialization time.
