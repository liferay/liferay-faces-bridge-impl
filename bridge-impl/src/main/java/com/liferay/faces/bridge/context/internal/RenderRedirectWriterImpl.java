/**
 * This class supports the render-redirect feature by queuing up a list of all write operations. Calling the {@link
 * #render()} method causes the queued operations to be invoked. Conversely, not calling the method will prevent the
 * queued operations from being invoked. This is necessary because in the case of a render-redirect, any markup written
 * to the response in the initially rendered view must be discarded.
