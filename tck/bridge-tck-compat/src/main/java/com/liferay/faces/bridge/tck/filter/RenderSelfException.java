/**
 * This exception is thrown by PortletRequestDispatcherTCKImpl.forward(PortletRequest,PortletResponse) in order to
 * work-around a problem in the design of the TCK. Specifically, the TCK incorrectly assumes that the bridge must render
 * the view itself because the Faces implementation is not able to render views in a portlet environment. This exception
 * is caught by ViewHandlerTCKImpl.renderView(FacesContext,UIViewRoot) so that it can proceed with invoking the Faces
 * implementation to render the view.
