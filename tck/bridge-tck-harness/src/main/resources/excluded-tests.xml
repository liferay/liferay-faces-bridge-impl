<!-- Test excluded because it relies on a (Mojarra) implementation dependency.  
     I.e. this test will run fine in a Mojarra JSF environment but not in others (like MyFaces) 

     Note:  to run this test you will need to uncomment out the comment in the include-war-modules profile in the TCK's root .pom -->

<!-- The following tests are excluded because encoding/supporting the secure URL feature isn't required in the portlet spec
     so not all containers may support it.

     If your portlet container does support secureURLs you should run this test manually -->

<!-- The following tests are excluded because PreDestroy support/notification relies on servletContext listeners - however when
     running in a local portal the portletContainer (is likely) executed using servlet cross-context support.  The servlet spec
     doesn't define if/how a cross-context app's servletContext listener is called when the primary app needs to make a notification.  
     Thus in a local portlet container these tests often don't work because the bridge isn't notified.  

     If your portlet container does support servletContext listener notification (that a request has ended) you should run these tests manually.
     For example if you are using a remote (WSRP-based) portlet container, this test should work. -->
