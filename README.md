## Building From Source

Using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x:

	mvn clean install

### Building the Liferay Faces Bridge Demos From Source

The [Liferay Faces Bridge demos](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces-bridge-impl/tree/master/demos) can be built seperately from the bridge. The demos can also be built for different versions of Liferay or Pluto.

To build a Liferay Faces Bridge demo from source:

1. Navigate to the demo you want to build (for example the jsf-applicant-portlet):

		cd liferay-faces-bridge-impl/demos/jsf-applicant-portlet/

2. Build the demo for Liferay:*

		mvn clean package -P liferay,mojarra,tomcat

	Or build the demo for Pluto:

		mvn clean package -P pluto,mojarra,tomcat

Once you have built the demo, the `target` folder will contain a war that you can deploy to the portlet container.

Alternatively, you can build all the demos at once:

1. Navigate to the `demos` directory:

		cd liferay-faces-bridge-impl/demos/

2. Build the demos for Liferay:*

		mvn clean package -P liferay,mojarra,tomcat

	Or build the demos for Pluto:

		mvn clean package -P pluto,mojarra,tomcat

\* **Note:** Some versions of the bridge are compatible with multiple versions of Liferay. For example, the Liferay Faces Bridge `4.x` version is compatible with both Liferay 7.0 and Liferay 6.2. To build demos for older versions of Liferay, specify the version in the profile. For example, specify `-P liferay62` to build a demo for Liferay 6.2. See the [Liferay Faces Version Scheme](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/understanding-the-liferay-faces-version-scheme#liferay-faces-version-scheme-for-releases-after-liferay-faces-ga6) for more details on the bridge's compatibility with Liferay versions.
