# Running the Liferay Faces Bridge Integration Tests

The Liferay Faces Bridge integration tests can be run from an IDE (such as Eclipse) or the command line. The test
framework expects that the tests have already been deployed to a running portal instance and have already been added to
the appropriate pages.

Before running the tests from the command line, you must navigate into the `test/integration` directory:

	cd test/integration

The tests can be activated by using the `selenium` maven profile. To run all the tests (PhantomJS and Liferay are the
default browser and container properties respectively):

	mvn verify -P selenium

Different browsers can be activated via the `chrome`, `firefox`, `jbrowser`, and `htmlunit` maven profiles. For example,
to run the tests on Firefox:

	mvn verify -P selenium,firefox

**Note:** HTMLUnit and [JBrowser](https://github.com/MachinePublishers/jBrowserDriver) may fail to open web pages with
*complex JavaScript due to their experimental/buggy JavaScript support. PhantomJS is recommended for testing complex
*pages in a headless environment. Chrome (or the slightly slower Firefox) is recommended for testing complex pages in a
*normal desktop environment. See the root `pom.xml` file dependencies section for the required versions of each browser.

Single tests and groups of tests can be selected via the the `it.test` property. The `it.test` property uses wildcards
to select tests from their fully qualified class names. For example, to run only the issue portlet tests:

	mvn verify -P selenium -Dit.test=\*issue.\*Test\*

Likewise, `-Dit.test=\*Applicant\*` would run only the applicant portlet tests, and `-Dit.test=\*demo.JSF\*` would run
only the non-applicant demo portlet tests.

The tests can also be run on Pluto Portal with the `pluto` profile:

    mvn verify -P selenium,pluto

The `integration.port` property controls which port the browser will navigate to in order to run the tests. For example,
if the portal is running on port `4000`, then the following command would be needed to test the portlets:

    mvn verify -P selenium -Dintegration.port=4000

All of the above properties and profiles can be combined to run tests in more complex scenarios. Here are some examples:

- Run the issue tests with Chrome against a Pluto Portal instance running on port 4000.
 
		mvn verify -P selenium,pluto,chrome -Dintegration.port=4000 -Dit.test=\*issue.\*Test\*

- Run the tests on Firefox against a Liferay 6.2 Portal instance:

		mvn verify -P selenium,liferay62,firefox

- Run the FACES-1635 test against a Liferay 7 Portal instance on Chrome:

		mvn verify -P selenium,chrome -Dit.test=\*FACES_1635\*

- Run the JSF Showcase testers (Liferay 7):

        mvn verify -P selenium-jsf-showcase,chrome

- Run the Alloy Showcase testers (Liferay 7):

        mvn verify -P selenium-alloy-showcase,chrome
